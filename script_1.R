## GitHub Workshop Feb 27 2023
# Exercise 1: created a new directory via file>new project>new directory>new
# project. Name for directory is 'my_new_repo' (it is a .Rproj) and checked
# box for 'create a git repository'

# then created a new file, 'script_1' which is a .R file.
# remember to 'save' often, saving this script resulted in it showing up in the
# git window with a green A icon and was available to 'commit'

# committed script and gitignore.

# edited script_1
